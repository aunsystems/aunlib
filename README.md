## ✴️ About ∿Lib

∿Lib is a prototype library based on the Aun Operator (∿), a symbolic construct representing collapse, nonduality, and failure of binary logic. It offers a new approach to adversarial filtering and post-quantum symbolic security.

## 🚧 Development Status

- Prototype live and documented  
- Whitepaper in progress (see `/arxiv`)  
- More examples and tests coming soon
