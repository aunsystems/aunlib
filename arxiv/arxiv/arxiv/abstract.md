# Abstract

∿Lib is a symbolic cryptographic filtering library based on the Aun Operator (∿), a conceptual construct that models collapse, nonduality, and adversarial ambiguity. Unlike traditional filters that rely on Boolean logic and fixed-state detection, ∿Lib introduces a symbolic layer capable of identifying structural collapse — points where standard binary separations (true/false, valid/invalid) break down under adversarial pressure.

This approach is particularly relevant for post-quantum threat models, where emerging attacks may operate beyond classical verification boundaries. By integrating ∿ logic with modern cryptographic schemes (such as CRYSTALS-Dilithium), ∿Lib enables early-stage detection of anomaly vectors that might otherwise evade scrutiny.

The project proposes a new way to think about security: not as the maintenance of rigid logic, but as the recognition of collapse patterns that precede failure. ∿Lib is a research-stage implementation and serves as both a prototype and a philosophical provocation about the future of cryptographic design.
