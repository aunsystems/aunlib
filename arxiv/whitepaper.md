# ∿Lib: Symbolic Cryptographic Filtering Using the Aun Operator

## Abstract

∿Lib introduces a novel symbolic filtering method based on the Aun Operator (∿), a metaphysical construct modeling collapse, nonduality, and adversarial failure. This whitepaper proposes a new class of symbolic adversarial filters applicable to post-quantum cryptography, integrity protection, and anomaly detection.

## 1. Introduction

Cryptographic models tend to rely on assumptions of separability: between sender and receiver, key and message, attacker and defender. The ∿ Operator collapses such assumptions. It provides a non-binary, symbolic structure capable of modeling complex adversarial states without relying on traditional logic gates.

This paper introduces ∿Lib, an implementation of symbolic filtering for cryptographic systems, and explores its theoretical basis, use cases, adversarial model, and performance benchmarks.

## 2. The Aun Operator (∿)

The Aun Operator is not a number, gate, or function — it is a symbol for collapse. It encodes the moment where logic loses its separation: ∿ is not "between" 1 and 0, but what remains when 1 and 0 collapse into one indistinct event.

∿ behaves more like a wavefront, an undecidable pulse through which contradiction is not resolved but rendered irrelevant. This opens new design space for cryptographic primitives that are not strictly Boolean.

## 3. System Overview

∿Lib is built as a modular symbolic filter. It wraps standard cryptographic verification routines with a layer of symbolic analysis, searching for ∿-encoded signals that suggest collapse vectors: moments where an adversarial structure might escape binary detection.

Key properties:

- Symbolic abstraction of input-output mappings
- Collapse-tolerant logic using ∿ as an operator
- Integration with post-quantum schemes (e.g. CRYSTALS-Dilithium)
